## mOTUlizer: Bayesian approach to leverage metagenomic bins for pan-genome analysis ##

Typicaly, in a large scale genome resolved metagenomic study, we make many different assemblies, from which we cluster many microbial genomes for each species. These are incomplete and contaminated, so only the best genome, as in most complete, and least contaminated, of a specific species will be picked, losing a lot of information. However, not every genome is "equaly" incomplete, the presence/abscence pattern of genes in a set of genomes can give us information. With mOTUlizer, we leverage this information to decide if any gene is either in every genome of this species, so part of the core-genome, or only in some, hence in the accessory genome. This method is fast and flexible and can be used on large data easily! So for more information feel free to chat with me at my poster or contact me by any mean!
